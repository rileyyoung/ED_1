	<h1> Yellow Car Replica Reflection </h1>
	<p> This reflection is all about our first 3D printing project. I replicated a small yellow toy car using OnShape and Cura. We explored the x, y, and z planes in order to fabricate our cars. </p1>

	<h2> Guidelines: </h2>
	<p> The guidelines for this project included a car fabricated on the x, y, and z planes, designed in a 1:1 ratio, with a size accuracy of +/- 1%. The project also required that the design be exported as an STL file, the proper use of Cura to provide support if needed, a final export as a gcode, and the final sharing of the embedded STL on an HTML webpage. </p>	

	<h2> Steps: </h2>
	<p> The steps were as follows:</p1>
	<ol>
	<li> engineering drawing </li>
	<li> scanning and uploading to OnShape </li>
	<li> creating profiles for each plane </li>
	<li> removal of negative space </li>
	<li> fabrication on Cura </li> 
	</ol>

	<h2> Design Process: </h2>
	<p> For the design process, I began by picking the yellow car that I was going to replicate. I traced the outlines of the car onto a sheet of graph paper and measured the car using calipers for an exact number. I made sure to make dark, clear pencil lines so they would be easily seen on the scanned document. </p1>

	<h2> Fabrication: </h2>
	<p> To bring our 3D cars to life, we fabricated them on OnShape, and then Cura. We began by creating a rectangular 3D envelope using our measurements we took from the engineering drawing. Then, we uploaded our scanned profiles from the engineering drawing and pasted them onto the x, y, and z planes. We created outlines on the planes using the line, circle, and arc tools. Finally, we removed the negative space, and added wheels and fillets. </p>


	<h2> GitHub Archive: </h2>	
	<p> I added all files to a GitHub archive. You can find the repository here: https://github.com/rileyyoung/ED_1/tree/master/3D%20Extrusion%20Car </p>

	<h2> Challenges, Setbacks, and Solutions: </h2>
	<p> A challenge I encountered in this project was struggling to size the top profile of the car correctly on OnShape. There was a lot of hang-off space, and I determined that I mismeasured the car when tracing it. I thought little of this mishap until I reached the end of the project and took proper measurements on OnShape and discovered my replica to have a notable percent error for the top profile. However, my car still looks proportional and resembles the yellow car it was based off of. In the future, I will be sure to measure and trace my car with extreme care, as I understand now the importance of accuracy on OnShape. </p1>
